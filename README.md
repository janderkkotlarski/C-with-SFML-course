# C-with-SFML-course
This is a course to get acquainted with C++, SFML and how to use both to put together a working program with a window and other multimedia capabilities.
It is recommended to have some programming knowledge prior to the course, but everything necessary will be explained during the course.

#1 Introduction
An overview of the course and its subjects are given, required software for different OS platforms is discussed.

#2 Hello program
An introduction how a C++ program is structured and how to compile and build it.

#3 Parameter types and constants
Parameter types and constants and their usage are explained.

#4 Operating on parameters
A look on what you can do to those defenseless parameters.

#5 Input, output and strings
Input, output and what strings are explained.

#6 Control the flow
Using if(/else) statements, for loops, while loops, etc. to control what your program does.

#7 Master the flow
Now we make a little program that uses the stuff learned from the previous lessons.

#8 How does this function
Learn how to make your own function and use it in your program.

#9 Arrays and strings
Explaining how make arrays out of parameters and how strings work.

#10 Pointers and dynamic memory
What are pointers, how do they work and how to allocate memory on the fly.

#11 Do I really need a library, teach?
Why you need your personal library and how to set it up and use it.

#12 Setting up SFML and making and manipulating a window in SFML
How do you set up and display a window using SFML.

#13 Displaying stuff in a window using SFML
Use SFML to display a basic shape or a sprite in SFML.

#14 More on displaying things with SFML
More indepth look on how to put graphical objects on the screen and how to manipulate them.

#15 Music is love, sounds are life
How do you do audio with SFML?

#16 A program with SFML
You make a small program using SFML, which can be a simulation, game or whatever you like to make.
